An unpublished research project in public health, completed during a data analysis course at the University of Toronto in February of 2025. The research question is as follows: `How do literacy and age of a marriage affect
family size?'. The provided dataset was from the World Fertility Survey in Portugal in 1979-1980. 

The project was completed in R and was submitted as a pair, including myself and one of my classmates. It follows a standard research paper format and includes a generalized linear model to predict family sizes in Portugal.
